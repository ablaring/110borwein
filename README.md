# 110borwein
=======

## Description
'110borwein' is a first-year mathematics project at Epitech.
It involves the computation of Borwein integrals using various numerical integration methods: the midpoint rule, the trapezoidal rule, and Simpson's rule.
The focus is not only on deriving the value of In, but also on determining the absolute difference between In and π.
The limit of the integral for this project is set to 5000. 
## Install and Run the project
### Requirements
---
To use the 110borwein, you need to install the dependencies and launch it locally on your PC.

*Clone the project:*
```
git clone git@github.com:ablaring/110borwein.git

cd 110borwein
```

*Run the project:*
```
./110borwein 0
```

Enjoy !

## Example of Program Execution
Here's an example of how you might run the 110borwein program and what the expected output would look like:

```
./110borwein -h
    USAGE
        ./110borwein n
    DESCRIPTION
        n constant defining the integral to be computed
```


```
./110borwein 0
